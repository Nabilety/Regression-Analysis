# As we concluded earlier from the R^2 coefficient earlier, we see the model fits the training data
# better than the test data, as indicated by the outliers in the y-axis direction. Also the distribution of
# the residuals does not seem to be completely random around the zero center point, indicating the model is not
# able t o capture all the exploratory information. However the residual plot indicates a large improvement
# over the residual plot of the linear model that we plotted earlier. Ideally our model error should be random
# or unpredictable. Meaning, the erro of the prediction should not be related to any of the information contained
# in the explanatory variables; rather it should reflect the randomness of the real-world distributions or patterns
# If we find patterns in the prediction errors, i.e., by inspecting the residual plot, it means that the residual plots
# contain predictive information. A common reason for this could be that explanatory information is leaking into those residuals.
# Unfortunately there is no universal approach for dealing with non-randomness in residual plots and requires experimentation
# Depending on the data available to use, we may be able to improve the model by transforming variables, tuning hyperparameters
# of the learning algorithm, choosing simpler/complex models, removing outliers, or including additional variables.
